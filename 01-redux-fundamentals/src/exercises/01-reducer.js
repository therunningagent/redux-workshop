const initialState = { value: 0 };

// ✅  use initialState as the default value for state if it is undefined when the function is called
function reducer(state, action) {
  // ✅ handle the type "counter/incremented" and add the payload to the state
  // ✅ handle the type "counter/decremented" and subtract the payload from the state
  // ✅ handle all other types by returning the state without modifying it
}

export default reducer;
